The file index.js shows how to create basic request using the express and node
It demonstrates how to create RESTful APIs 
1. GET
2. POST
3. PUT
4. DELETE

Run the index.js in the terminal using - node index.js

Also inorder to deploy each and every change everytime I have used nodemon, 
you can install it with command npm i nodemon
nodemon creates and server and restarts it when a change happens automatically
